                        I recently added a few animations to my personal site to improve its aesthetics and the result I think was excellent. You can refresh this page to see the animation in action. The animations were added using the React Framer motion library.

                            The main theme of "Steal Like an Artist" by Austin Kleon centers on the idea that creativity is not about producing something entirely original, but about finding inspiration in the work of others. Kleon argues that all artists, whether they realize it or not, borrow ideas from those who came before them. Creativity involves a process of collecting ideas, remixing them, and transforming them into something unique. By "stealing" like an artist, one can learn from various sources, embrace influences, and develop a distinctive creative voice. Kleon‚Äôs book encourages readers to view creativity as a collaborative and cumulative process, rather than a solitary act of invention.
